Barbarisms by barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious victorious kneel
For brand new spankin' deals
Marching forward hypocritic and
Hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Kneeling roses disappearing into
Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into fort knox stealing
Our intentions
Hangers sitting dripped in oil
Crying freedom
Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Blast off!

And we don't live in a fascist nation!
Blast off!

They disguise it, Hypnotize it.

Life is a waterfall,
We're one in the river,
And one again after the fall.
Swimming through the void
We hear the word,
We lose ourselves,
But we find it all?
Cause we are the ones that want to play,
Always want to go,
But you never want to stay,
And we are the ones that want to choose,
Always want to play,
But you never want to lose.
Aerials, in the sky,
When you lose small mind,
You free your life.

Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar, sugar
I'm not there all the time you know
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane, yeah they call it insane
I play Russian Roulette everyday, a man's sport
With a bullet called life, yeah mama called life
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there
The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?

It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her, and then ooh baby
She's okay
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they really want to do
Is suck out my mother fucking brains, my brains
More sugar
The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
I sit, in my desolate room, no lights, no music
Just anger, I've killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away

I have a problem that I cannot explain
I have no reason, why it should have been so plain?
Have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reason, why I should be so confused?
I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
Around you
Left a message but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playing the show and running down the plane
I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
Around you
The piercing radiant moon, the storming of poor June
All the life running through her hair
Approaching guiding light, our shallow years in fright
Dreams are made winding through my head
Through my head
Before you know, awake
Your lives are open wide, the V chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair
The spiders all in tune, the evening of the moon
Dreams are made winding through my head
Through my head
Before you know, awake
Through my head, through my head
Before you know, before you know I will be waiting all awake
Dreams are made winding through her hair
Dreams are made winding through her hair

Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when Savior comes is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die
They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find no truth
He's never going home
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

Conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
The pictures of time and space are rearranged
In this little piece of typical tragedy
Justified candy, brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
You and me we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue Of Liberty and a generation that didn't agree
You and me we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue Of Liberty and a generation that didn't agree
I forgot to, I forgot to let you know that
Justified candy, brandy for the nerves

Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice

You and me we'll all go down in history

To the cries of human suffering

Push them around, a deer dance
Invitation to peace, war staring you in the face

Dr. Jekyll in lower case
Mr. Hyde caps.
It's over now I know inside.
No one will ever know.
The sorry tale of Edward Hyde,
And those who died, no one must ever know.
They'd only see the tragedy,
They'd not see my intent.
The shadow of Hyde's evil,
Would forever kill the good, that I had meant.
Am I a good man?
Am I a mad man?
It's such a fine line, between a good man and a...
DO YOU REALLY THINK,
THAT I WOULD EVER LET YOU GO?
DO YOU THINK, I'D EVER SET YOU FREE?
IF YOU DO, I'M SAD TO SAY
IT SIMPLY ISN'T SO
YOU WILL NEVER GET AWAY FROM ME!!
All that you are is a face in the mirror!
I close my eyes and you disappear!
I'M WHAT YOU FACE WHEN YOU FACE IN THE MIRROR,
LONG AS YOU LIVE, I WILL STILL BE HERE!
All that you are is the end of a nightmare.
All that you are is a dying scream.
After tonight, I shall end this demon dream!
THIS IS NOT A DREAM, MY FRIEND
AND IT WILL NEVER END!
THIS ONE IS THE NIGHTMARE THAT GOES ON!
HYDE IS HERE TO STAY
NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY PRETEND!
AND HE'LL FLOURISH LONG AFTER YOU'RE GONE!
Soon you will die, and my silence will hide you
You cannot choose but to lose control.
YOU CAN'T CONTROL ME
I LIVE DEEP INSIDE YOU!
EACH DAY, YOU FEEL ME DEVOUR YOUR SOUL!!
I don't need you to survive like you need me,
I become whole as you dance with Death!
And I'll rejoice as you breath your final breath!
I LIVE INSIDE YOU FOREVER!
No!!
WITH SATAN HIMSELF BY MY SIDE!
No!!
AND I NOW KNOW THAT NOW AND FOREVER!
THEY''LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEPARATE
JEKYLL FROM HYDE!
Can't you see
It's over now?
It's time to die.
NO NOT I!
ONLY YOU.
If I die,
You die too!
YOU'LL DIE IN ME,
I'LL BE YOU!
Damn you Hyde!
Leave me be!
CANT YOU SEE?
YOU ARE ME!!
No! Deep inside-
I AM YOU!
YOU ARE HYDE!
No, never-
YES, FOREVER!
God damn you, Hide!
Take all your evil
deeds, and rot in hell!
I'LL SEE YOU THERE,
JEKYLL!
Fish that don't drown

Now leaving town
Life in a bubble jungle
Seeing you believing us adhering
The power struck
Believing you then kneeling appeasing
The power struggle
We're left with no arms right in
The power struggle
We're left with no arms right in
The power struggle
Wearing a crown
Life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was waiting for you

Life in a bubble jungle
Seeing you believing us adhering

Believing you then kneeling appeasing

Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the right
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight
While you are talking all detached, so tell us
Where are you going?
To the bottom
Do you hear us?
We are rotting
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide
The masked comforts to delusionals, they're all in fright
The true believer's head was bathed in sunlight
While you are walking all detached, so tell us
Where are you going?
To the bottom
Do you hear us?
We are rotting
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
Not even God, no one saved us
No one's gonna save us
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Superstition taking all of us for a ride

While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached
Going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
(Not even God)
No one saved us, no one saved us
No one saved us, no one's gonna save us now
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
I have a home
Longing to roam
I have to find you
I have to meet you
Signs of your face
Slowing your pace
I need your guidance
I need to seek my inner vision
Inner vision
My pupils dance
Lost in a trance
Your sacred silence
Losing all violence
Stars in their place
Mirror your face
I have to find you
I need to seek my inner vision
Inner vision, Inner vision
It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile that brings forth energy or life
Giving you force
It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile that brings forth energy or life
Giving you force
Vision
There's only one true path in life
The road that leads to all leads to one
There's only one true path in life (inner vision)
The road that leads to all (inner vision)
Inner vision
Your sacred silence
Losing all violence
I need not fear the love, you love to love the fear
I never want to be alone, I've forgotten too
The road keeps moving the clouds, the clouds become unreal
I guess I'll always be at home
Do you want me to try? Directing your night
An exit lights the sky, the sky becomes complete
Traveling hearts divine the throne, I've forgotten too
Friction, lines, bumps, the highway song complete
The signs are all turning right
Do you want me to try? Directing your night
Want me to try? Directing your life
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never coming back
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never ever coming back
Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
Can you feel their haunting presence?

Kaleidoscope of love
ophidian's dance as the shifting occurs
we are stars and electric animals
nurtured by the mothers of prostitutes
floating in a mushroom... universe
swimming in a sea of... cyberstroms
and as we surface through the tide
you open up and I come inside
hey! hey! hey! hey!
I must we limbo?
'cause purgatory's always felt just like home!
and as the world spins round and round
we fornicate upon the cotton clouds
that rain... down... sulfur smiles on the
children at play in the poppy fields
sinking for what seems like... forever
like Atlantis into the sea...
to forget the shore and wash away
wash away my memory
hey! hey! hey! hey!
I must we limbo?
'cause purgatory's always felt just like home
Hoo-hoo!Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!
Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!
Inside the moon...
lives the high priest of the mushroom cult
upon the altar...
are the ashes of the pharisees
I sold my soul... sold my soul...
I sold my soul away
I'm free of guilt... free of sin
free of everything

Seven A.M., morning, came to take us away
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads
Seven A.M., morning, came to take us away
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads
At our, at our heads
Your prospect of living is gone
You ran the light at dawn
Protectors on your back
The lights are on their track
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car
Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig
Put your hands up, get out of the car
When your stars are baked
And your rivers fly
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the
Sky?
When your castle breaks
And your feet are dry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the
Sky?
Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried?
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky
When you're high
When your moon is fake
And your mermaids cry
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the
Sky?
When your tunnel fades
And your guide is shy
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the
Sky?
Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried?

Yeah
1 - How many niggas that'll die for you
How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you
I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you
Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you
How many niggas that'll die for you
How many get a quiche like the pie, wit you
I ain't talkin' 'bout those that get high with you
Niggas know, if a red's on ya head, then they ride with you
[Puff Daddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I'mma ride for you, would you ride for me?
Well, I'mma die for you, would you die for me?
Obviously, we all know you type of cats
Let they man get struck, never strike back
Stay in the street, seven days a week
Shit get hot, you never blaze your heat
Stupid motherfucker wanna play me sweet
So I keep 'em on his toes, that way he never sleeps
Bigger than the king and the Pope, sling no dope
Call me anything but broke
When it's on, I guarantee my team don't choke
Want a war, you niggas better bring yo' force
And when I say we won't quit, believe this shit
When I talk about a Benz, let you see the 6
And when I'm talkin' to a ho, let you meet my bitch
When Puff talk, you niggas take heed to this
Repeat 1
[Mase]
Yo, if you down to act, we came to scrap
We beef '89, still watch your back
A nigga smack me, I'mma smack 'em back
If it lead to the guns, then that be that
And lately, niggas that snake me, just make me
Wanna send 'em heat without AC
Thinks I'm sweet, taste me
How much you really want it?
Enough to put a mil' on it or your deal on it?
This year Cancun, guess who I'm going wit
My own niggas, see I pay my own trip
Make my own chips, I copped my own 6
I knock my own shit, like I'm on my own dick
My day be short, need coke, raid the fort
I'm knocked by the cops, come blaze the court
And though niggas die for, go on the shelf
Disrespect and spend like a man below your belt
Me, I always had, so I never go for self
Had thousand dollar bills with Teddy Roosevelt
Better slow down, tellin' you now, put the dough down
Kick your door down, surround the block
Where you go now?
Fifty shots spit at you and that is not a whole round
Way I leave the furniture, think it was co-found
Here's the low-down, messin' with Mase gotta go down
What more could I say but hey, guess you niggas know now
Repeat 1
[Lil' Kim]
Motherfuckin' right I'mma roll with my motherfuckin' dogs
Bitches ain't around when it's time to go to war
This shit here, nothing to fuck with
I'm the same bitch all ya'll wanna try ya'll luck with
Lil' Kim spread like syphilis
You think I'm pussy?
I dare you to stick your dick in this
Chrome 4-4, inconspicuous in the 6-0-0, shit's ridiculous
Speak when you're spoken to and only with permission
Like E.F. Hutton, when I talk, niggas listen
So don't ya'll be mad at me, 'cause I'm the Q to the B
To the motherfuckin' E-E
Copped my CD, now all ya'll wanna be me
See me on the TV, beds will dip in 3-D
Peep the CD, chromed out and phoned out
My shit is paid for, your shit is loaned out
I gets it on, money keep growin'
Ice fully glowin', plus I'm bad to the bone
In the danger zone, I hold my own when the pain is gone
Like a splinter I enter
So why should I throw my blows in those
Do a bit upstate and take the weight for your troubles
My nigga B.I.G, I'mma ride for
But it ain't too many niggas that I'd die for
Repeat 1
Life is a waterfall
Were one in the river
And one again after the fall
Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go
But you never want to stay
And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play
But you never want to lose
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go
But you never want to stay
We are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play
But you never want to lose
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes
Eternal prize
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes

Life is but a dream drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems all of what remains, ego brain
And they'd shame, shame, love after it rains
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
I am just a man fighting other men for land, for land
While I turn to sand in spite of the pain, ego brain
And they'd shame, shame, love after it rains
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand you took me by the hand
And declared, that love prevails over all
All of what remains, ego brain
And they'd shame, shame, love after it rains
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
Love after it rains

Breathing each others' lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone
The cold insincerity of steel machines
Have consumed our euphoria
Transforming us into muted dreams
Dreaming of the day that
We attack, attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack, attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack, all the years of propaganda
We shall attack
Books illustrate what we already know
Candles cry towards the sky
Raising your flags along polluted coasts
Dreaming of the day that
We attack, attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack, attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack, all the years of propaganda
We shall attack
Attack
Attack
Breathing each others' lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone
Breathing each others' lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone
What's the philosophy of displaced mines?
The bombing of all homes and villages
Truth is the only sword bleeding minds
Bleeding till the day that
We attack, attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack, attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack, all the years of propaganda
We shall attack
Attack all the homes and villages
Attack all the schools and hospitals
You attack, all the rapes and pillages
We shall attack
We shall attack

Crack pipes, needles, PCP and fast cars

If I feel like talking, I never be wrong
If I feel like walking, you best come along
I close my windows crank the heat up high
Till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
I'm a midnight fistfight looking for a mother that will get me high

Could you help me?
I don't know.
Dark is the light, the man you fight
With all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold, this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the holy land was taken?
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness?
That lead the noble to the East
To fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the evil
No wait we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
No wait we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it
No international security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill man, history teaches us so
Reason he must attain, must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the evil
No we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
No we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your building's crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV
Overbearing advertising
God of consumerism
And all your crooked pictures
Looking good, mirrorism
Filtering information
For the public eye
Designed for profiteering
Your neighbor, what a guy
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God, your child has born
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations
With the blinded flag
Manufacturing consent
Is the name of the game
The bottom line is money
Nobody gives a fuck
4000 hungry children leave us per hour, from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs, creating death showers
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Why must we kill kind
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the God, your child has born
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb

What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain
(cocaine)
Something blowing in my head
Winter's ice, it soon was dead
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold
(cocaine)
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really a loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
(cocaine)
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
A tribute to Black Sabbath!
Flaunt your will at every wheel
Parachute your chocolate soul
Cobblestones under your [incomprehensible]
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
Circumvent your thick ego
Wooden [incomprehensible] they're on the go
You can't tell me that [incomprehensible]
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
Fear waits, for us
When the present can't be sealed
Away, gold dust
Now the dishes can be cleared
Fear waits, for us
Till the moment is revealed
Then turns to rust
For the mighty conquered meal
Can't you look at my shamed ass?
Ounce is gone and God is once
You can't see me suddenly
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Come join the cause, come join the cause
Who wants to come with me and come join the cause
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
You and me should go outside
And beat em', beat em', beat em'
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Realize you're blind
And we're out of time it'll show your mind
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
It'll show your mind that you have a mind
Ain't no more sunshine, just rain and cold suffering
Generation born to die with their eyes wide open
The clock strikes
The wrong rights
The mob rules
The second Armageddon, igniting the lit fuse
No turning back
Every soldier is on point
Ready to die, the confrontation coming, ready or not
It's on again,
It's time to say your prayers again
It's not the end, just the beginning of the end
(Chorus)
But is it hard?
Yea, I can hold it down like that
But is it real?
Yea, You know I break it down like that
But is it rough?
Don't even try to front like that
I'm on fire baby, a big dog will hunt like that
Another day, another buster wanna battle me
Another mama crying, now her baby is a casualty
I'm ready nigga, slice like a machete nigga,
got fetty nigga, never spend it on Betty nigga
I hit and run, never stressing to look back
When I look back, I think about the love I never had
Then I wake up, I get fucked up and I get even
Approach you from the front
While in your back a knife I'm leaving
(Chorus)
But is it hard?
Yea, I can hold it down like that
But is it real?
Yea, You know I break it down like that
But is it rough?
Baby don't even try to front like that
I'm on fire dog, a nigga will hunt like that
The sky is falling, I don't care
I just want to feel good
Her train's leaving, she don't care
She just wants to feel good
The world's dying, we don't care
We just want to feel good
It's all over, we don't care
We just want to feel good
Hey, let me get some of that Jack Daniels
Let me check out some of that porno, dog
Let me hit that joint
No no no no no no don't take 'em off
Leave 'em on, leave 'em on
I like that shit
Now roll and like that shit
And get on with this shit
Come on
Nah! We can't compromise like that
Nah! We can't conform like that
I'm saying fuck you and fuck the norm like that
Revolt and transform like that
Make a difference
Have a motherfucking impact!
It won't stop raining, its flooding, Revelation was all true
You drew first blood, Jesus is coming to take you
Coming to break you, make you just like new
Satan laughing, spreads his wings and gets a new tattoo
A new platinum chain, a new pinky ring,
The Rolex, the Benz, the huggy bear pimp thing
Nigga it's midnight, never forget where you come from
Keep your mouth shut
Back the fuck up
Watch what you doing
Punk
Bitch
Motherfucker
What? Come on!
(Chorus)
But is it hard?
Yea, I can hold it down like that
But is it real?
Yea, You know I break it down like that
But is it rough?
Don't even try to front like that
I'm on fire baby, a big dog will hunt like that
The sky is falling, I don't care
I just want to feel good
Her train's leaving, she don't care
She just wants to feel good
The world's dying, we don't care
We just want to feel good
It's all over, we don't care
We just want to feel good
We just want to feel good
We just want to feel good
We just wanna feel good
We just wanna feel good
Prefight delight
Defaced street lights
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now
Popcorn everywhere canned
Clich people organs rare
Corn everywhere canned
Clich people cannot
Dare, dare, dare, dare
I want to be
A fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people organs rare
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people cannot
Dare, dare, dare, dare, dare, dare
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people organs rare
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people cannot dare
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people organs rare
Humans everywhere canned
Clich people cannot
Dare, dare, dare, dare
The phoenix, he helped create
Out of control boy, without a dad
Shot the gun that startled my life
While I drove him with a forty five
Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfuckin' head
Confidence, death, insecurity
Te men fall unrealized
Unrealized, unrealized
Making a decision of death
While everyone around you pled
Now you fly in peace
I hope, my friend
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do
When he's meant to do it
Even if he doesn't really want to
My memories are of fun and friendship
Of weakness within the strength of youth
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfuckin' head
Confidence, death, insecurity
The men fall unrealized
Don't you realize
Evil lives in the motherfuckin' skin?
Don't you realize
That evil lives in the motherfuckin' skin?
Don't you realize
Evil lives in the motherfuckin' skin?
Don't you, realize
Evil lives in the skin?
Don't you realize
Evil lives in the motherfuckin' skin?
Don't you realize
That evil lives in the motherfuckin' skin?
Why the fuck did you take him away from us, you motherfucker?
Fucker? Fucker? Fucker?
I will never feed off
The evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live
In the valley of the walls
When we speak
We can peak from the windows
Of their mouths to see the land
The women chant as they fly up to the sun
You never think you know, why
Know, you never think you know, why
Know, ever think you know, why
Know, know, know
Books all say different things
While people flap their yellow wings
Trying to soar by being a whore of life
And almost everything
The sheep that ran off from the herd
May be dead but now's a bird
Able to fly able to die
Able to break your cursed earth
You never think you know, why
Know, you never think you know, why
Know, ever think you know why
Know
On the other side, the other side, other side
Do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly?
Have you ever wanted to die
You ever want to die?
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly
Unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, you ever try to die.
Know, you never think you know, why
Know, you never think you know, why
Know, you never think you know, why
Know, ever think you know, why
Know
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you
I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can see you across the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can see you through the snow blind
But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I know time reveals in hindsight
I can hand wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snow blind
But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbye
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you
But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye, goodbye
Watching from a post up high
From where you see the ships afar
From a well trained eye
The waves all keep on crashing by
If you are the light post
Then you own the working class
But if you want the answers
You better give a piece of ass
Give a piece of your ass
Warning, post hypnotic suggestions
Running the ships ashore
The orange light that follows
Will soon proclaim itself a God
If you point your questions
The fog will surely chew you up
But if you want the answers
You better get ready for the fire
Get ready for the fire
"Kill Rock 'N Roll"
So I felt like the biggest asshole
Felt like the biggest asshole
when I killed your rock and roll
Mowed down the sexy people
Every time I look in your eyes, every day I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you
About how I...
So I felt like the biggest asshole
(Felt like the biggest asshole)
When I killed your rock n roll
(Mowed down the sexy people)
Every time I look In your eyes, every day I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you
About how I...
Eat all the grass
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen In the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen In the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen In the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen
Every time I look In your eyes, every day I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you about how I...
I, I..
So I felt like the biggest asshole
When I killed rock n roll
When I felt like the biggest asshole
When I killed rock n roll

The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect undeniable data
About beta carotene and theta waves
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
Then, the senses wanted the sky
All rise, eyes bound
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect undeniable data
About high pulse weapons and microwaves
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
Then, the people found out the lie
All rise, eyes bound
Now our eyes have been found
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside
Waiting to
Get you high
Waiting to
Touch the sky
All rise, eyes bound
Now our eyes have been found
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles in
